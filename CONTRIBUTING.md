# Contributing guidelines

- All pull requests must be made to `dev` branch

- When implementing a feature related to downloading, follow the rule of choice: Every download must come from an active decision made by the user (e.g. clicking a download button, deciding the user wants a whole artist's discography, etc.). This takes out of the picture features like recommendation algorithms, auto-genererated playlists, etc.
